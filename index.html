<h2>Why Meta-Research?</h2>
<p>
  As the field of Human-Computer Interaction continues to evolve, it is becoming increasingly important to thematize the <span class="keyword">growing pain points in HCI research</span>, not only in steering and working groups, but also in rigorous
scientific publications. Self-reflective and meta-scientific contributions are critically important to
advance the HCI field as a whole. Yet, little research and self-reflection is being published in HCI. It is time for the
CHI community to pause and reflect on how things have progressed in the past decade and where we are headed.
<span class="keyword">Meta-research</span> is the study of research practices. Meta-research and the science of science offer
valuable insights into how HCI as a field can refine its methodological frameworks, enhance rigor, and address
its challenges.
However, meta-research contributions on HCI currently have no dedicated venue at ACM conferences,
and the CHI Conference currently has no fitting subcommittee for meta-scientific investigations.
In the past, such investigations have been relegated to poster contributions or adjunct proceedings
(&quot;alt.chi&quot;) where the investigations might not get all the attention they deserve.
This is suboptimal and also contrasts with the field’s critical and self-reflective tradition.

<h2>Objectives of the workshop</h2>

<p>
This one-day workshop aims to bring together researchers,
practitioners, and reviewers within the HCI community and beyond to explore and discuss meta-research.
By critically evaluating the processes underlying HCI research, we can improve the ways in which studies are
conducted, reported, and assessed, fostering a culture of transparency and methodological rigor.
<!--
Given the cross-disciplinary nature of HCI, CHI — its flagship conference — serves as the ideal venue to discuss these topics,
thanks to its diverse community in terms of background, practice, and perspectives.
-->
The workshop will provide a forum for researchers to share, discuss, and brainstorm their ideas about improving
the current state of meta-research in HCI. We aim to provide a common platform for meta-research in HCI, and
to establish a research agenda for meta-scientific investigations in HCI.

<p>
This workshop is for anyone in the HCI community who cares about understanding, cataloging, and improving
the ways we conduct research. By taking a step back and looking critically at how we design, conduct, and
share our work, we can identify areas where we can improve. The goal is to create a space where we can safely
and openly discuss the challenges of HCI research and develop practical ways to ensure that HCI research is
as rigorous, transparent, and impactful as possible.
</p>

<p>
This workshop is intended to mark the starting point of a meta-research community in HCI that outlasts the workshop event.
The workshop will be a catalyst for change in the CHI and HCI community.
<!--
The potential for meta-research
to produce meaningful impact is manifold. The Meta-HCI workshop explores how the HCI field has evolved,
its methodologies, and its impacts. This provides an opportunity for researchers to reflect on the direction HCI
research is heading and what has worked or needs to be rethought. The workshop provides a platform for critical
engagement with the field, encouraging researchers to question assumptions, frameworks, and biases in HCI
research. This fosters a more mature, self-aware research community. Meta-research encourages researchers to
scrutinize the relevance of the work being presented at CHI in the context of real-world HCI problems. This can
help ensure that future CHI research addresses pressing societal and technological issues, making the research
more impactful. By examining trends in meta-HCI, researchers can identify gaps and areas where HCI needs to
evolve, creating a shared agenda for future research. This is particularly relevant in the fast-developing field of
HCI which is continuously reshaped by new technologies.
Meta-research is also an important source for policy and guideline development.

    <h4>What we study in HCI</h4>
    <!--
    <div class="breakoutimg" style="background-image:url(img/photo-1523430237819-5fdfeb4f5604.jpg);background-position:center 54%;"></div>
    -->
    <p class="breakouttxt">
      <!--HCI research involving human factors reflects the zeitgeist and ethos of its time.-->
      In recent years, research in HCI has been influenced by the rapid proliferation of large language models, conversational systems, and other generative systems. On the negative side of this development, the availability of these writing machines that can &quot;delve&quot; into any topic and simulate participants opens opportunities for bad actors to productionize their output at the expense of quality.
      Further, some community members have voiced strong opinions recently about how a disproportionate number of HCI work is now thematizing or using generative AI.
      Prompt-hacking (akin to p-hacking) is a growing cause for concern.
      Yet, generative AI also has transformative positive potential in how we conduct research at large, and going forward it makes sense to shed light on those ways and try to identify the constructive and creative ways of using them ethically and responsibly.

    <h4>How we conduct research</h4>

    -->
    <p class="breakouttxt">Generative AI aside, there are other fundamental issues to focus on in terms
of how we conduct research. For instance, the &quot;replication crisis&quot; has been identified earlier but
not necessarily fully addressed yet. Expectations of the field also steer the ways we work. For instance, the
CHI Conference has seen an increase in the quality expectations for published works. Arguably, some of the
research published ten years ago would no longer meet the minimum requirements of today’s CHI Conference.
For instance, the number of references included in a CHI paper has increased with each year since CHI '16,
and most likely this is now an implicit expectation by reviewers. From a pure knowledge-creation perspective, it
is also fascinating to understand the citation behaviors of the community.</p>

    <p class="breakouttxt">Peer review is an integral part of research, but it faces a number of recognized limitations.
<!--As the field evolves, peer review changes.-->
Currently we are hearing the signals from the HCI community in terms of how, for instance, generative
AI is used, should be used, or should not be used in peer review. Other aspects include the obsession with
novelty and the lukewarm reception of negative but nonetheless interesting results.
Unclear policies can result in inconsistently enforced desk rejections and peer reviews.
<!--Differing ethics policies among institutions is a constant topic of debate in peer reviewing.-->
And the entire community now feels the increased workload in review duties, leading to difficulties in identifying the best reviewers for the research. There is a growing urgency to act on these issues. For instance, the CHI Steering Committee recently established a one-year working group on peer review. The working group's objectives include evaluating the potential for
the introduction of a credit system for peer review and the establishment of more consistent norms and
policies.</p>

    <p class="breakouttxt">The nature of what we evaluate has evolved, with submissions now including various adjunct materials (video figure, data sets, submission history, etc.) that may influence the peer review process in many subjective ways.
    It is easy to envision how the current format is not the &quot;final optimal&quot; way of documenting research.
  In addition to what we publish, there is also the consideration of how much we publish.</p>

<h2>Workshop Schedule</h2>
<p>
  We aim to kick-off the event with a keynote (TBA).
  The first part of the workshop will then give room for participants to briefly present their submissions.
  Instead of prescribing activities, we provide a smorgasbord of activities and topics (see above) to work on in the second part of the workshop.

<h2>Call for Participation</h2>
<p>
The Meta-HCI workshop invites researchers and practitioners to discuss meta-research in HCI.
Meta-research focuses on studying research practices and offers insights into how HCI can enhance its
methodological frameworks, improve rigor, and address the field’s growing challenges.
</p>

<p>
This one-day workshop will serve as a platform for the HCI community to share thoughts and experiences
with meta-research, and collectively examine the processes that shape the research in our field. The workshop themes include, but are not limited to, what we study and publish in HCI, how we conduct and evaluate research in HCI, how HCI research
affects us, and how the broader context of science affects HCI research.
</p>

<p>
Participants are invited to submit short papers (5–6 pages, references excluded) or full papers (min. 6 pages, references excluded) in the form of studies, experiments, bibliometric and scientometric investigations, or other meta-scientific research.
Since meta-research is an emerging area in HCI, we also accept short position papers (2–5 pages, references excluded).
Submissions should use the CEURART 1-column template. The workshop organizers will review submissions primarily based
on their potential to stimulate engaging discussions.
At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the workshop and attend the event.
<!--
At least one author of each accepted paper must
attend the workshop and all participants must register for both the workshop and for at least one day
of the conference. More details about the workshop can be found in the call for proposals.
-->
</p>

<p>
Manuscripts should be submitted as email attachments in pdf format
by <span class="keyword">March 14, 2025</span>
to the workshop co-chairs at
<strong><a href="mailto:meta-hci@oulu.fi">meta-hci@oulu.fi</a></strong>.
</p>

<p>
We look forward to your contributions and to welcoming you to an exciting
and productive discussion on the future of HCI research practices!
